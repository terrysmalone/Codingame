# Implementation

## Set up

At the start of the game create a variable `_resourcesToClosestBase`. Find the closest base to each resource and store that in the variable.

## Game loop

After reseting all the relevant counts

### Update 

We get a string input for each cell. For each of these we do the following:

#### Update cell

Update the eggs, crystals, and player and opponent any count in that cell

#### Update ant counts

Increase the overall counts for each player

### Get actions

// List<string> actions = game.GetActions();
//
