## TODO

Semi-ordered list of priorities

- Calculate sporers in all directions (currently only do west)
- Add tentacles (As a first pass just attack the enemy if they get close)
- If I run out of options at the end just try to do something (i.e. Spawn any organ that I have the points for)

### Speed up

- Calculate useful boards at the start of each round so we don't have to do so many searches
  - Walkable squares board
  - Adjacent squares board (All squares neext to my organism)
