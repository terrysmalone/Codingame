Spread out more if we can. Don't be a bomb target

---

When looking for cover consider shortest path rather than manhattan distance

I'm missing too many bomb shots. Start considering if the enemy can move oout of range
	Example: 
	Orange: amurushkain
	Purple: me
    seed: seed=-491234015931941300
	Description: AI miss with bombs at 9 and 10

BUG: When calculating shot I use the movePoint, but when I move to attackPoint that move is often too far away, resulting in invalid shots. 

I should fix this as part of adding path finding
