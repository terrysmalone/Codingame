## TODO

Semi-ordered list of priorities

- Calculate sporers in all directions (currently only do west)
- Add tentacles (As a first pass just attack the enemy if they get close)
- If I run out of options at the end just try to do something (i.e. Spawn any organ that I have the points for)

### Speed up

- Calculate useful boards at the start of each round so we don't have to do so many searches
  - Walkable squares board
  - Adjacent squares board (All squares neext to my organism)

## Test seeds

Lots of Protein near the original root 
seed=-8773989171102688000

No walls
seed=-5857682269723621000

It creates a spore and then blocks it straight away
seed=8116729794577537000

On move 14 I should buld a harvester on 3,6
seed=-9015237039626058000

Lots of Protein all over a big map. My code times out pretty quickly on this
seed=-1361847611390843400

Starting with a spore here would be good
seed=-7134633389896397000

I block myself in pretty early here
seed=-3605073768287950000

Pretty nice battle I should be able to test lots on
seed=8520556949647951000

Lots of proteins, not many walls
seed=-6630469394645055000
