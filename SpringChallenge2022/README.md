# TODO

* Work on making defenders more active
  * Give them a number of breakpoints so they go further out
* Defenders shouldn't be going for the same monster so often
* Defenders shouldn't attempt to control the same monster


* Attacker needs to be more active
  * He sits in the base even if nothing is going on. 
  * He should start outside the base and move in with the monsters
